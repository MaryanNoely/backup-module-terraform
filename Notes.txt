Step 1: Opt in to use AWS Backup
If this is your first time using the AWS Backup service, you must opt in to use AWS Backup and cross-account management features using the AWS Management Console or CLI.

To opt in using AWS Management Console (recommended):
Open the AWS Backup console in your management account and from the left navigation pane, choose Settings, and then choose Enable for Backup policies, Cross-account monitoring, and Cross-account backup.
The status of the cross-account management settings would change to Enabled.
Ensure that you have enabled your supported workloads in the Service opt-in
You can refer to the existing AWS Backup blog on cross account, cross-Region backup for additional help with using the AWS Management Console for service opt-in.


To opt in using AWS CLI or CloudShell:
Open the configured AWS CLI or CloudShell to access your management account and run the following command.
Note: You need to include your AWS Organizations Root OU ID in the first CLI command.

    aws organizations enable-policy-type --root-id r-<INSERT-YOUR-ROOT-OU-ID>
    --policy-type BACKUP_POLICY

    aws organizations enable-aws-service-access --service-principal 
    backup.amazonaws.com

    aws backup update-global-settings --global-settings 
    isCrossAccountBackupEnabled=true
